# 🔐 Back Office Front Microservice

This microservice provides a **front-end interface** for internal back office operations, interacting with a local database via multiple exposed routes.
---

## 🚀 How It Works

The service communicates with the **API** through various **routes** to impact (create, read, update, delete) the local database.

## 🎴 Technologies Used

- ⚛️[**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/): A React-based framework for building server-rendered and statically generated web applications.
- ⚛️[**React**](https://react.dev/): A declarative JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- ⚛️[**SASS (JWT)**](https://sass-lang.com/): A CSS preprocessor to write more maintainable and cleaner stylesheets.
- ⚛️[**Pino**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pino): A fast and lightweight logger for Node.js.
- ⚛️[**Pino-pretty**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pino-pretty): Pretty prints logs from Pino for better readability during development.

## 🔒 Security

_Even though the service is simple, it relies on a **JWT** obtained through the **login process**. This `token` is **required** for **all** communications with the local API._

_While the `token` is signed server-side with a secret key **(JWT_SECRET)**, make sure to never expose or commit sensitive files like your `.env` to a public repository._

## 📬 Notes

This microservice is designed to be used only in a **local Back Office context**.

It simply interacts with a local API 😄
